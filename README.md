## Getting Started

**TES3Unity requires a valid installation of Morrowind to run!**, you can get it on Steam or Gog.com.

To get started, go to the release tab and download the latest release for your device.
Alternatively you can download the source code as a ZIP file, extract it, and open the TES3Unity folder in Unity.

If you want to enjoy VR, take a look at `README-VR.md`. Finally input mapping is located at `README-Input.md`.

### StreamingAssets folder
You can copy data files into the `StreamingAssets` folder, that way you don't need to worry about file location.
The required path is `StreamingAssets/Data Files/`.

### Desktop
The game will ask you where is the **Data Files** folder the first time you start the game. If you move your Morrowind installation, the game will ask you again where is the **Data Files** folder.
  
### Mobile
You've to copy the **Data Files** folder into a folder named `TES3Unity` on your SDCard. If the game can't open the game, please open an issue.
