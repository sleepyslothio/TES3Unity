## Getting Started

**TES3Unity requires a valid installation of Morrowind to run!**, you can get it on Steam or Gog.com.

To get started, go to the release tab and download the latest release for your device.
Alternatively you can download the source code as a ZIP file, extract it, and open the TES3Unity folder in Unity.

Take a look at the `README-Config.md` file to tweak parameters. If you want to enjoy VR, take a look at `README-VR.md`. Finally input mapping is located at `README-Input.md`.

### Desktop

### Mobile
